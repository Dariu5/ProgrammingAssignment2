## These two functions performs inverse matix calculation. 
## Results are cached and repeated computations are avoided.

## Creates function vector, that allow storage of variable in other enviroments

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Calculates inverse matrix, if it is already calculated gets result from cache 

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
